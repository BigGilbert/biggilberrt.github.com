						THE CB GROUP INVESTMENT ANALYSIS<br class="mobile-hide" />
						BY <a href="http://html5up.net" class="nobr">BIG GILBERT</a>
					</p>
					<p class="style3">A Music Label <strong>CB GROUP</strong>, needed some data-driven insights on investment.
						 They had just signed a new Artist and were ready to make investments, but it had to be data-driven. The Artist already had some music released before the signing and the label were looking to kick off investment with one of the released songs of the Artist.
						Kicking off my analysis, I collected the available Data of the Artists' Digital Streams and Downloads and also had a sit-down with the Artist to ask some questions that could possibly be useful for my Analysis.  The task goals were to; 
						<strong> 	Provide a data-driven insight on which of the Artistâ€™s songs to invest in.</strong> and <strong>	 To also give data-driven advice on the profiting areas by which this investment is to be made.</strong>
